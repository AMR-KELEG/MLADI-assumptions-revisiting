Accepted to [ACL 2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/).

## Data
Since the dataset is also used for the Multi-label Arabic Dialect Identification (MLADI) leaderboard, requests to get access to the dataset can be submitted through the following [link](https://forms.gle/gdgTToxG2tH5xT27A).

## Replicating the Analysis
* Asm. 1 - Arabic Dialects Rarely Overlap

* Asm. 2 - Only Short Sentences‚Äô Dialects
are Ambiguous

* Asm. 3 - Dialects‚Äô Distinctive Lexical Cues

* Asm. 4 - ALDi Perceptions acros

    abstract = "Arabic has diverse dialects, where one dialect can be substantially different from the others. In the NLP literature, some assumptions about these dialects are widely adopted (e.g., ``Arabic dialects can be grouped into distinguishable regional dialects'') and are manifested in different computational tasks such as Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). However, these assumptions are not quantitatively verified. We identify four of these assumptions and examine them by extending and analyzing a multi-label dataset, where the validity of each sentence in 11 different country-level dialects is manually assessed by speakers of these dialects. Our analysis indicates that the four assumptions oversimplify reality, and some of them are not always accurate. This in turn might be hindering further progress in different Arabic NLP tasks."
